# Technical implementation Plan 
The user will begin by opening the Quotes Application and is then presented with the main menu. They will be presented with the option to search by keyword which will allow them to type a category they want to search by. This will find the quote based on that keyword and return that quote/quotes to the user on the screen.

# First user story 
As a user I will be presented with a list of keywords I can look for quotes in the quotes application by inputting my search keywords.

# Second story 
As a user I will be able to use the quotes application to search a quote using a keyword, that will be presented on the screen by the application

# Third final story 
As a user of the quotes application, I will be able to search for a quote using a keyword, after looking at some predefined keywords on the screen, and have the quote/quotes be displayed on the screen to look at.
